# ecommerce-transaction-analysis
Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an eCommerce data analysis assignment. The project involves the following tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzing customer, product, and transaction data.

Generating insights and visualizations to understand business trends.

Lookalike Model:

Recommending similar customers based on profiles and transaction histories.

Assigning similarity scores to the top three recommendations for each customer.

Customer Segmentation:

Clustering customers into groups using profile and transaction data.

Evaluating the clustering model with metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Index.

Visualizing the clusters for better interpretability.
